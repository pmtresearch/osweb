step 1a - python basic variables: numbers
a: 21
b: 10
c: 0
d: 3.1415926
c = a + b - value of c is  31
c = a - b - value of c is  11
c = a * b - value of c is  210
c = a / b - value of c is  2.1
c = a % b - value of c is  1
c = a ** b - value of c is  16679880978201
c = a//b - value of c is  2

step 1b - python basic variables: strings
Hello World!
H
llo
llo World!
Hello World!Hello World!
Hello World!TEST

step 2a - python extended variables - list = array in javascript
["abcd",786,2.23,"john",70.2]
[123,"john"]
abcd

step 2b - python extended variables - tupple = JSON in javascript
["abcd",786,2.23,"john",70.2]
[123,"john"]

step 2c - python extended variables - dictionary = JSON in javascript
{}
{"name":"john","code":6734,"dept":"sales"}

step 3 - python basic operators
var a = 10, var b = 10
a == b true
a != b false
a > b false
a < b false
a >= b true
a <= b true

step 4 - if then else
1 - Got a true expression value
100
2 - Got a false expression value
0
Expression value is less than 200
Which is 100

step 5 - loops
2  is prime
3  is prime
5  is prime
7  is prime
11  is prime
13  is prime
17  is prime
19  is prime
23  is prime
29  is prime
31  is prime
37  is prime
41  is prime
43  is prime
47  is prime
53  is prime
59  is prime
61  is prime
67  is prime
71  is prime
73  is prime
79  is prime
83  is prime
89  is prime
97  is prime

step 6 - Python libraries (math/string/time
c = 3
floor(c) 3

step 7 - OpenSesame vars
0
my_value
my_value
my_value2
my_variable exists!

step 8 - Open Sesame clock functions
7223
This should be 5000:  5024

step 9 - Open Sesame canvas functions
Showing canvas1:  13089
Showing canvas2:  14087
Showing done:  14103
